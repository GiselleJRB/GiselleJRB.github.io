### CPSC 120

* [Lab 03](https://github.com/cpsc-spring-2023/cpsc-120-lab-03-giselle-kevin/tree/main/part-2)

    Lab 3, part 2 was my favorite becuase I realized that being calm is very important. This program caused me to struggle the most, though I understood what I was suppose to do, I kept overthinking making things more complicated that it needed to be. Having the right people and giving myself breaks, allowed me to keep level headed find the solution to the problem.

* [Lab 07](https://github.com/cpsc-spring-2023/cpsc-120-lab-07-giselle-and-kyle/tree/main/part-2)

    Lab 7, part 2 was my second favorite becuase I revisted a program that was limited to two cards, now be able to handle ulimited cards. Knowing that changing TwoCardHandScore function to HandScore function helped me realize that programs are interchangable. The programs are not set in stone, as long as you have the passion and patience any program can be updated.

* [Lab 06](https://github.com/cpsc-spring-2023/cpsc-120-lab-06-giselle-yuuji-1/tree/main/part-1)

    Lab 6, part 1 was my third favorite becuase I was able to solve the error without asking help from TAs or Professor. I was stuck on the CountMultipleOfThreeAndFive function, I used the internet to give me samples, using them I did multiple trial and errors. In all of these trials I was listening to music, gave myself breaks which ultimately solved the error.
